## About
The Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster project is a classic machine learning challenge hosted on Kaggle. The challenge revolves around predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. It serves as an introductory project for beginners in the field of data science and machine learning, providing an opportunity to apply fundamental concepts and techniques to a real-world dataset.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a passenger survived or not. By analyzing the provided dataset and training a machine learning algorithm on historical data, the goal is to predict the survival outcome for passengers in the test dataset.

## Features
- Utilizes the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.
- Implements various machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict survival outcomes.
- Provides an ideal starting point for individuals looking to dive into the field of data science and machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
